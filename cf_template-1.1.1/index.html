        it's more presentational by saying my name first. My name is Pheng Her and I am 27 years old. I from St. Paul Park, Minnesota. In a few
      sentence I will be explaining a little bit about my background, interest, and goals. My ethnic is Hmong which I know some of you might not
    know or have heard of and no we are not Mongolia. On my spare time I like to give it to my wife and family but I do have goals that I would like
  to accomplish in a timely manner. For example finish my online program with CareerFoundry by January 18th, 2019. </p>
